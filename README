# TemperatureMonitor

TemperatureMonitor is a demonstration of a complex, scalable embedded system for temperature monitoring. 
It follows a layered, modular architecture that abstracts low-level hardware details (such as I²C, GPIO, Timer, and ADC) from high-level application logic. 
The project supports both simulation mode (for PC-based testing) and a real-hardware mode.


## Prerequisites

- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)
- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

## Build Instructions
A Windows batch script is provided in the `scripts` folder to build and perform a clean rebuild of the project.

1. **Open Command Prompt** (or Git Bash) and navigate to the project root directory:

   ```batch
   cd path\to\TemperatureMonitor
   
   scripts\build.bat

   To perform a clean rebuild, run:

   scripts\build.bat clean

   To run:
   cd .\build\
   then
   release/temp_monitor.exe
