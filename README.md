# TemperatureMonitor

TemperatureMonitor is a demonstration of a scalable embedded system for temperature monitoring. 
It follows a layered, modular architecture that abstracts low-level hardware details (IÂ²C, GPIO, Timer, and ADC) from high-level application logic. 
The project supports both simulation mode (for PC-based testing) and a real-hardware mode.
